    <p>GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects</p>
    <p>New to git? Follow the steps below to get comfortable making changes to the code base, opening up a pull request (PR), and merging code into the primary branch. Any important git and GitHub terms are in bold with links to the official git reference materials.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 0:Install git and create Github Account</h2>
    <p>The first two things you'll want to do are install git and create a free GitHub account.</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions here to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command. A note: 95% of other online git resources and discussions will also be for the command-line interface. </p>
    <p>Once you've done that, create a GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/login" target="_blank">here</a></p>
    <h3>Git and Github</h3>
    <p>A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.</p>

    <h2>Step 1:Create a local git repository</h2>
    <p>When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (or often, 'repo', for short). </p>
    <p>To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the git init command: </p>
